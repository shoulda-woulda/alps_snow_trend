### A Study of Snowfall Trends in a Sample of European Ski Resorts


__Overview:__ This project investigates the trend of snowfall levels in European Ski Resorts. The motivation for this study arises from personal experiences in the Alps, where a noticeable decline in snowfall has been observed. The goal is to quantify and visually represent this trend.

__Purpose:__ The primary objective is to shed light on climate change issues using a relatable perspective. By showcasing the decline in snow levels, the project aims to raise awareness of our environmental impact and the effect on the future of snowsports in the Alps. Snowsports lovers (typically wealthier demographics) represent a key target audience for promoting sustainability and environmental responsibility.
